Development Goals:

High Level Goals:

- Create an application, Rasterizer, which allows users to manipulate pixels on a canvas using various tools.
- Follow a highly portable design pattern in which core application logic is completely platform agnostic, and simple platform specific "glue" layers handle interfacing between the host and core program logic.
- Learn about CPU based rasterization.

Low Level Goals:

- Complete JS prototype.
